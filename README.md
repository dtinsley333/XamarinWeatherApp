This code sample is based on the online tutorial that lays out how to create a solution in Visual Studio that complies apps in the native code for ios, android, and windows.

In order to completed the ios project you will need to be able to remote into a Mac to run the emulator. IOS apps must be complied on a MAC. The android
emulated is already included when using using Xamarin. 

I chose to use MacInCloud to host an Mac Instance. http://www.macincloud.com/
